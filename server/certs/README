Use this script (make_certs.sh) to create:

* A root Certificate Authority with which to sign other certs,
* A signed server cert for the test server, and
* An identity cert to load into the MDM enrollment profile.


Some notes, especially for iOS 4.x:

Even with a trusted CA on the device, the server cert may be rejected by
Mobile Safari without all kinds of alternative names in the cert. This is
especially true when you're using an IP address for the server instead of
a DNS name.

So you'll want to set appropriate IP addresses in the "server.cnf" file
(near the bottom).


When creating the certificates, I've used the following as "Common Names":

CA: MDM Test CA
Server: <server IP address>
Identity: My Device
